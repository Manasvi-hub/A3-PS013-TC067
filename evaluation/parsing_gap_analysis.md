## Gap Categories Discussion

- **no_regex_match**: The log line format does not match the parser's expected regular expression. This is typically a tool limitation (e.g. unknown daemon) but can also happen for malformed input.
- **bad_timestamp**: The timestamp could not be parsed into a valid date/time. Often caused by corrupted logs or unexpected date formats (malformed input).
- **truncated**: The log line ends abruptly, possibly due to a crash, disk full, or bad network transfer (malformed input).
- **empty_line**: The log line consists entirely of whitespace. Usually safe to ignore (malformed input / noise).
- **encoding_error**: The line contains non-UTF-8 bytes. Caused by binary data dumped into logs or different encodings (malformed input).

## What the tool does not parse

- RFC 5424 syslog format
- Apache error log
- JSON logs
- Multi-line stack traces (often recorded as multiple invalid lines)
- Non-UTF-8 logs
- DST-ambiguous local times
